# Music OCR

## Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to be able to understand the melody encripted in a printed music sheet.

## Steps

The first part is to use OpenCV functions in order to reorient the sheet to the right format, to seperate the staves and to identify the locations of the notes.

The second step is to use a classifier (neural network) to identify the notes.

Then, using the positions of the notes found at the first step and the identification in the second one, we are able to reconstruct the melody and play it.
