## Description
Engineering school work. 

Depending on the course, I do not own most of the code (done by the professors), just a repository to clone the codes I'm working on for projects and assignments.

## Authors of the codes:
You can check the course pages, contact these professors of Ecole polytechnique via their email addresses that are available, and even see the exercises they are suggesting and compare them to the implementations available on this repository
